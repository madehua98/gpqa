This means the angular velocity remains constant (C).  The net force is not zero, meaning the center of mass will accelerate according to Newton's second law (F = ma).  Since the force varies periodically, the acceleration of the center of mass will also vary periodically, and its velocity and thus its kinetic energy will also vary periodically (A).  The center of mass will not move in a straight line (B), nor will its speed be zero (D), nor will its linear velocity remain constant (E). The direction of motion of the center of mass can change (F). Since the net torque is zero, the angular acceleration is zero, and therefore constant, not constantly changing (G).

Specifically, the Darcy-Weisbach equation simplifies to:\n\nh_f ∝ Q/D^4\n\nIf the diameter is doubled (2D) and the flow rate is doubled (2Q), the new head loss becomes:\n\nh_f' ∝ (2Q)/(2D)^4 = 2Q/16D^4 = (1/8)(Q/D^4)\n\nSo the new head loss is 1/8 of the original. Since the question asks how many *times* the original, we take the inverse of 1/8, which is 8. The options don't have 8 for laminar flow. It seems the question intended to ask for what *fraction* of the original, so we stick with 1/8.

In this case, the gain is $G = e^{100} \\approx 2.688 \\times 10^{43}$. The input power is 10 mW, so the output power is $P_{out} = G P_{in} = 2.688 \\times 10^{43} \\times 10 \\text{ mW} = 2.688 \\times 10^{44} \\text{ mW} = 2.688 \\times 10^{41} \\text{ W}$.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the output light's wavelength broadens within the gain bandwidth of 10 nm, and follows a Gaussian distribution with a central wavelength of 550 nm and a standard deviation of 1 nm. The gain coefficient is given as 100, which implies that the total output power is $P_{out} = G \\times P_{in} = e^{100} \\times 10 \\text{ mW}$.\n\nThe power gain is 1000, so the average output power is $1000 \\times 10 \\text{ mW} = 10000 \\text{ mW} = 10 \\text{ W}$, not the exponentially large value calculated initially.\n\nSince the wavelength follows a Gaussian distribution, the power at any wavelength $\\lambda$ can be given by $P(\\lambda) = P_0 e^{-\\frac{(\\lambda - \\lambda_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$, where $P_0$ is the peak power, $\\lambda_0$ is the central wavelength (550 nm), and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation (1 nm).  The total power is $10 \\text{ W}$.  The average power can be approximated as the total power, which is 10000 mW.\n\nThe power at 551 nm can be calculated by considering that the Gaussian distribution is normalized, and the total power is 10 W.  However, we're given that the gain bandwidth is 10 nm, which means the effective FWHM is approximately $2.355 \\sigma = 10$ nm, so $\\sigma \\approx 4.25$ nm. Thus, the power at 551 nm is not significantly different than the power at 550 nm.  Since the question mentions that the standard deviation is 1 nm, we'll proceed with that value for $\\sigma$.\n\nGiven a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 1 nm and centered at 550 nm, the power at 551 nm can be calculated using the formula $P(\\lambda) = P_{max} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda - \\lambda_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$. In our case, $\\lambda = 551$ nm, $\\lambda_0 = 550$ nm, and $\\sigma = 1$ nm. Therefore, $P(551) = P_{max} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(551 - 550)^2}{2(1)^2}\\right) = P_{max} e^{-0.5} \\approx 0.6065 P_{max}$. The average power is approximately the total power, which is 10000 mW = 10 W. Therefore, $P(551) \\approx 0.6065 * 10000 \\approx 6065 \\text{ mW}$. None of the provided options match this result. However, the average power should be 10 W (10000mW), which points to options B and F. The question asks for the power at 551 nm, and since the distribution is Gaussian, it will be less than the peak power. Thus, the correct average power appears to be 10000 mW (10W), which doesn't correspond directly with a power of 900mW or 950 mW at 551 nm. Thus the problem appears inconsistent. Assuming the average output power is 1000mW (10W), and given the available options, 900mW or 950mW at 551nm are the possible choices. The closest option is 950 mW. Therefore, the answer seems to be 1000mW, 950mW.\n\nAnswer: B\n"}}

The ball gains kinetic energy as it falls. When it hits the spring, the kinetic energy is converted into elastic potential energy.

Gravity is what gives the ball its initial potential energy, which is then converted into kinetic energy and finally into spring potential energy. Gravity is essential to the whole process.

When it contacts the spring, the spring force acts upwards, opposing gravity. As the spring compresses more, the spring force increases, further opposing gravity. This means the net force on the ball decreases, and so does its acceleration. This is true.\n\nJ) The mass of the spring influences the ball's behavior.  A massless spring is an idealization.

The core issue is uncontrolled cell *division*, not specifically lipid production.\n* **Evading apoptosis:** Cancer cells often avoid programmed cell death (apoptosis), which normally eliminates damaged or abnormal cells.  While B) states \"completely avoid,\" it's more accurate to say they have a reduced sensitivity to apoptotic signals.\n* **Angiogenesis:** Cancer cells stimulate the formation of new blood vessels to supply themselves with nutrients and oxygen, supporting their rapid growth.\n* **Tissue invasion and metastasis:** Cancer cells can invade surrounding tissues and spread to distant sites in the body (metastasis). This relates to I) Organizational infiltration.\n* **Genome instability and mutation:** Cancer development is driven by accumulated mutations in genes that control cell growth, division, and DNA repair.\n* **Deregulated cellular energetics:** Cancer cells often rely on different metabolic pathways than normal cells, but they *do* require energy, making J) incorrect.\n* **Sustained proliferative signaling:** Cancer cells often exhibit self-sufficiency in growth signals, meaning they don't rely on external signals to divide, contradicting F).\n\nConsidering the above, the unique characteristics are B (though not absolute), E, H, and I.  G, frequent cell division, is a consequence, not a defining characteristic.\n\nAnswer: BEHI\n"}}
